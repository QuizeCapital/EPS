## `Results and Comments`

To explain the results , there are 4 metrics to use as benchmark for success of our strategies:

*Significant outperformance for the top quintile. For single-factor strategies, which have large average portfolio sizes (usually over 300 companies), I like to see at least a 2% average excess return for the top quintile versus the Universe. For more focused, two-factor strategies, excess returns of 4% or more are preferable.
*Significant underperformance of the bottom quintile. For single-factor strategies, the bottom quintile should underperform the benchmark by 2% or more on average (i.e., excess returns should be 􏰀2%—negative 2%—or lower); for two- factor strategies, 4% underperformance or more. If a strategy is to be used for short sales, underperformance of 8% to 10% or more is preferable.
• Good linearity of excess returns among the quintiles. This means that the top quintile should outperform the second quintile, which should outperform the third quintile, and so on. The smoother, or more linear, the trend of excess returns, the higher my assurance that the strategy really works (i.e., that it is a general, well-founded strategy that works for many stocks and not a statistical anomaly).12
• Strong consistency of returns over time. The top quintile of a strategy should outperform the Universe for 60% or more of the annual periods tested. Strategies that outperform 70% or more are preferable.13 The bottom quintile should underperform the Universe by 60% or more. Again, 70% under- performance or higher is preferable. Along with this, I’d much prefer a strategy that provided consistent but moderate excess returns over the years to
