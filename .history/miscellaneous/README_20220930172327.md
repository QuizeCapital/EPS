## `miscellaneous`

While the other directories in this repository are focused on code and data, this folder can serve as laboratory notebook where you can write down various details about your project. I find it useful to break this up by section where I can easily share a direct link if someone asks for a protocol. 

Files that may not be code, but are important for reproducibility of this project's findings. This includes pictures, screenshots , research papers, books, important links etc
