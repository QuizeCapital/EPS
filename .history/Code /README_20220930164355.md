## `Codes`
In this directory, I store codes of this research project. 

Th code utilises a class function which is cosisits of child functions that 
call their own unique variables. 

The function get_eps connects to the financial modelling prep API and downloads earnings per share for as long as a company has existed and calculates the eps growth rate by utitlising the formula 

$$
\triangle eps = -[abs(\frac{eps^0}{eps^t})]
where\ t = ending timeframe used for analysis
$$
