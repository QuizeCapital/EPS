## `Codes`
In this directory, I store codes of this research project. descriptions
and processing scripts such that updating them for each experiment is simple.
In the example `README.md` file, I've put parameters that need to be changed in
bold capitalized text so it is easy to review.  While it may be tempting, **never copy one experimental folder to another, even if you know it's exactly identical.** It takes only a few minutes to read through a file and change a handful of parameters and can save you much misery in the future.
